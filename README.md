# Image-Quantization

### Brief Description:
The idea of color quantization is to reduce the number of colors in a full resolution digital color image (24 bits per pixel) to a smaller set of representative colors (color palette). Most standard techniques treat color quantization as a problem of clustering points in three-dimensional space, where the points represent colors found in the original image and the three axes represent the three color channels.

##### Main Points Of The Project:
1.	Palette Generation:  A palette generation algorithm finds a smaller representative set of colors C = {c1,c2,c3,â€¦,ck}  from the D distinct colors.
2.	Quantization: by mapping the original colors to the palette colors.
3.  Detailed Analysis of each part in the code.
